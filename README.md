# üõçÔ∏è Retail Sales Analysis using SQL (PostgreSQL)

## üìå Project Overview

This project explores a **retail sales dataset** using SQL in PostgreSQL to derive valuable business insights. It mimics real-world retail scenarios, answering questions like *Which products sell best? Who are the top customers? What times are busiest?* The dataset includes customer demographics, purchase details, and sales metrics across multiple product categories.
---

## üéØ Objectives

- Perform **data cleaning and validation** to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Use **SQL aggregation, window functions, CTEs, and case statements** to solve real business questions.
- Analyze **customer behavior, product performance, and time-based trends**.
- Practice **SQL storytelling** suitable for dashboards and client reporting.

## üöÄ Next Steps (Suggestions)

- Add **data visualizations** using Tableau, Power BI, or Matplotlib.
- Run **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis for customer segmentation.
- Predict customer lifetime value using machine learning.
- Build an **interactive dashboard** with Streamlit or Dash.
- Convert queries into **stored procedures** or **views** for production.
