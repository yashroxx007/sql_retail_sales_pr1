# üõí Retail Sales Data Analysis Project

## üìå Project Overview

This project explores a synthetic retail sales dataset using SQL. It involves data cleaning, exploration, and comprehensive analysis to derive insights on customer behavior, product performance, and temporal sales trends. The SQL queries are written and executed in PostgreSQL.

## üéØ Objectives

* Clean and validate the dataset.
* Explore and understand the data.
* Solve common business questions using SQL.

## üóÉÔ∏è Dataset Schema

```
transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
sale_date DATE,
sale_time TIME,
customer_id INT,
gender VARCHAR(10),
age INT,
category VARCHAR(20),
quantity INT,
price_per_unit FLOAT,
cogs FLOAT,
total_sale FLOAT
```

## üßº 1. Data Cleaning

### üîç Check for NULLs

```sql
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    transactions_id IS NULL
    OR sale_date IS NULL
    OR sale_time IS NULL
    OR customer_id IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR age IS NULL
    OR category IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL
    OR price_per_unit IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR total_sale IS NULL;
```

### üßπ Delete NULLs

```sql
DELETE FROM retail_sales
WHERE 
    transactions_id IS NULL
    OR sale_date IS NULL
    OR sale_time IS NULL
    OR customer_id IS NULL
    OR gender IS NULL
    OR age IS NULL
    OR category IS NULL
    OR quantity IS NULL
    OR price_per_unit IS NULL
    OR cogs IS NULL
    OR total_sale IS NULL;
```
